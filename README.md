These will be replaced by your asset pipeline or content management process.
- Content is ready-to-use and customizable. Replace placeholder content with your own as needed.
- Font placeholders like font-[primary-font] and font-[secondary-font] indicate category-appropriate typography that your system should map to actual font imports.

Enjoy building your devotional experience around Krishna!
